# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
This is a Java application to visualize a few sorting algorithms such as Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Randomized Quicksort etc. I used Swing to render graphics for the visualizer.

## Motivation
The purpose behind developing this program was to get well versed with the popular sorting algorithms before my summer course on Data Structures and Algorithms and to learn more about GUI, concurrency, and threads. Watching the visualization of sorting algorithms helps to understand the internal workings of the algorithm, making it easier to reproduce these algorithms.

## Steps to run the project
1. Compile and run the project using command line or some IDE (eg. IntelliJ)
2. Click on one or more of the sorting algorithm checkboxes, depending on whichever algorithm you want to visualize.
3. Watch the sequential visualization of each algorithm selected.

## Demo
Below is an animation of a sample run to visualize Merge Sort and Randomized Quicksort.
